1.1 Exercises

- Use the command `pwd` to see whatâ€™s your current directory

```
pwd
```

- Use `mkdir` to create a new directory `stat`

```
mkdir stat

```
cd stat
```

```
curl -O http://textfiles.com/food/bread.txt
```

- Use the command `ls` to list the contents in your current directory

```
ls
```

- Use the command `curl` to download these other text files:

- Use the command `ls` to list the contents in your current directory

```
ls
```

- Now try `ls -l` to list the contents in your current directory in long format

```
ls -l
```

```
man ls -r
```

```
ls -lt
```

```
ls *.txt
```

- Use the wildcard `*` to list all the files with extension `.csv` in reverse order

```
ls -r *.csv

```
ls ????.csv
```

- The command `ls *[1]*.csv` should list `.csv` files with names containing the number `1` (e.g. `mid1.csv`, `minutes1.csv`). Adapt the command to list `.csv` files with names containing the number `2`.

```
ls *[2]*.csv

```
mv ../bread.txt txt-files
ls txt-files
```

- Use the wildcard `*` to move all the `.txt` files to the directory `txt-files`. Without changing directories, use `ls` to confirm that all the `.txt` files are inside `txt-files`.

```
mv ../*.txt txt-files
ls txt-files
```

- Use the wildcard `*` to move all the `.csv` files to the directory `csv-files`. Without changing directories, use `ls` to confirm that all the `.csv` files are inside `csv-files`.

2. Unix Filters and Pipes
Basic Bash Command (*B*ourne *A*gain *Sh*ell)

- `cut` allows you to select columns
- `paste` allows you to merge columns
- `sort` can be used to arrange lines
- `sort` can also be used to group by lines
- `sort` and uniq can be used to count occurrences
- `grep` allows you to filter rows

*Redirect* `>`: save command output to a new file (existing file will be overrided)
*Redirect* `>>` : update command output to a file (added after last line of existing file)

```
             name     brand  price weight height     bestuse  seasons capacity
1   fly-creek-ul2 big-agnes 349.95    960     96 Backpacking 3-season 2-person

```

- Display names of first 5 tents
```{bash}
cut -f 1 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | head -n 5
```

- Redirect the previous operation with redirect operator `>` to the text file `name5.txt`
```{bash}
cut -f 1 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | head -n 5 > name5.txt
```

- Confirm that `name5.txt` has the tent names
```{bash}
head name5.txt
```

- Sort the names alphabetically
```{bash}
cut -f 1 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | head -n 5 | sort 
```

- Sort the names alphabetically in reverse order
```{bash}
cut -f 1 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | head -n 5 | sort -r
```

- Write a pipe to get the names of the last 5 tents (no sorting required)
```{bash}
cut -f 1 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | tail -n 5
```

- Write a pipe to get the name and brand of the first 5 tents
```{bash}
cut -f 1,2 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | head -n 5
```

- Write a pipe to get the name, bestuse, and capacity of the last 5 tents
```{bash}
cut -f 1,6,8 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | tail -n 5
```

- List all unique `bestuse` category
```{bash}
cut -f 6 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | sort | uniq
```

*compare only next lines... use `sort` to extract only unique categories for apart lines*

- Count frequencies for each `bestuse` category
```{bash}
cut -f 6 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | sort | uniq -c
```

- Take the previous command and pipe it again with sort in order to display the categories (and their counts) in increasing order
```{bash}
cut -f 6 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | sort | uniq -c | sort
```

- Write a pipe to list (i.e. display) the unique categories of seasons
```{bash}
cut -f 7 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | sort | uniq
```

- Write a pipe to list (i.e. display) the unique categories of seasons and their counts
```{bash}
cut -f 7 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | sort | uniq -c
```

- Cut both bestuse and seasons, and pipe them to sort and uniq to get the counts for all possible combinations of categories from bestuse and seasons
```{bash}
cut -f 6,7 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | sort | uniq -c
```

- Find (match) those rows of tents with brand marmot
```{bash}
grep "marmot" tents.csv
```

- Count how many marmot tents are in tents.csv (i.e. counting number of lines)
```{bash}
grep "marmot" tents.csv | wc -l
```

- Create a file with the data for marmot tents marmot-tents.csv
```{bash}
grep "marmot" tents.csv > marmot-tents.csv
```

- Include column names to the file marmot-tents.csv
```{bash}
head -n 1 tents.csv > marmot-tents.csv
grep "marmot" tents.csv >> marmot-tents.csv
```

- Pipe grep with wc to count the number of tents from brand rei
```{bash}
grep "rei" tents.csv | wc -l
```

- Write a similar pipe to the one above to find how many Backpacking tents are in tents.csv
```{bash}
grep "Backpacking" tents.csv | wc -l
```

- Write a pipe to create a file big-agnes-tents.csv containing the data for tents of brand big-agnes
```{bash}
grep "big-agnes" tents.csv > big-agnes-tents.csv
```

- Write commands to create a file kelty-tents.csv containing the data for tents of brand kelty, arranged by name alphabetically. This file should have column names in the first line (i.e. first row)
```{bash}
head -n 1 tents.csv > kelty-tents.csv
grep "kelty" tents.csv | sort >> kelty-tents.csv
```

- Write a pipeline to obtain the unique categories of bestuse (column 6). The output of the pipeline should contain only the categories (NOT the counts). HINT: cut, sort, and uniq are your friends.
```{bash}
cut -f 6 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2| sort | uniq
```

- Write a pipeline to obtain the counts (i.e. frequencies) of the different bestuse values (column 6), displayed from largest to smallest (i.e. descending order). The first column corresponds to count, the second column corresponds to experience. Redirect the output to a text file bestuse-counts.txt. A HINT: cut, tail, sort, uniq; and redirection > operator, are your friends.
```{bash}
cut -f 6 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2| sort |uniq -c
```

- Use output redirection commands to create a CSV file msr-tents.csv containing data for the msr brand. Your CSV file should include column names in the first row. HINT: redirection operators > and >>, as well as head and grep are your friends.
```{bash}
head -n 1 tents.csv > msr-tents.csv
grep "msr" tents.csv >> msr-tents.csv
```

- Use the previously created file msr-tents.csv to select, separately, the columns name, weight, and price. Store each column in a text file: name.txt, weight.txt, and price.txt
```{bash}
cut -f 1 -d "," msr-tents.csv > name.txt
cut -f 4 -d "," msr-tents.csv > weight.txt
cut -f 3 -d "," msr-tents.csv > price.txt
```

- Use the previously created files name.txt, weight.txt, and price.txt to paste them (i.e. merge them), in that order, into a new CSV file msr-prices.csv (comma separated values!!!).
```{bash}
paste -d "," name.txt weight.txt price.txt > msr-prices.csv
```

- Write a pipeline to list (display) the five largest prices in decrasing order.
```{bash}
cut -f 3 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | sort -r -n | head -n 5
```

- Write pipelines to create a file top10-tents.csv containing the top10 tents by price from largest to smallest. Your CSV file should include tent name, brand, price
```{bash}
head -n 1 tents.csv > top10-tents.csv
cut -f 1-3 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | sort -k 3 -t "," -r -n | head -n 10 >> top10-tents.csv
```

```{bash}
cut -f 1-3 -d "," tents.csv | tail +2 | sort -k 3 -t "," -n -r | head -n 10
```
